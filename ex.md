[**Meta-analysis: Use of proton pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer in patients requiring gastric acid suppression.**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.17360)


1.  **What is the purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis?** The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to investigate the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the risk of gastric cancer.
    
2.  **What were the main findings of this study?** The main findings of this study were that there was no statistical evidence of an association between PPIs and gastric cancer when considering studies that addressed confounding in a comprehensive manner. The certainty in the summary effect estimate was low.
    
3.  **Why did the authors focus on studies using H2 receptor agonists (H2RAs) as the comparator group?** The authors focused on studies using H2RAs as the comparator group because they may be at similar risk of developing gastric cancer with respect to those exposed to PPIs. This choice was motivated by epidemiological considerations, as exposure to PPIs may be associated with several known and unknown prognostic factors for gastric cancer, making it difficult to comprehensively handle confounding when using unexposed individuals as the comparator group.
    
4.  **What were the limitations of this study?** The limitations of this study included the fact that the evidence was of low certainty, as non-randomized studies are prone to residual and unmeasured confounding. Additionally, the rarity of the event made it difficult to perform exceptionally large and lengthy randomized trials that would be needed to provide reliable estimates.
    
5.  **What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice?** These findings suggest that PPIs may result in trivial to no difference in the risk of gastric cancer. However, due to the low certainty of the evidence, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

**Efficacy and Safety of Drugs for Gastroparesis: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.**

In a network meta-analysis, oral dopamine antagonists and tachkinin-1 antagonists were more efficacious than placebo for gastroparesis, but confidence in the evidence was low to moderate for most comparisons. There is an unmet need for efficacious therapies for gastroparesis.

1.  What is the focus of the systematic review and network meta-analysis described in the text?
    
    -   The focus of the analysis is drugs used to treat gastroparesis.
2.  How many RCTs and patients were included in the analysis?
    
    -   The analysis included data from 29 RCTs containing almost 4000 patients.
3.  What drugs were found to be significantly more effective than placebo in improving global gastroparesis symptoms?
    
    -   Clebopride and domperidone were found to be significantly more effective than placebo in improving global gastroparesis symptoms.
4.  Which drug classes were found to be superior to placebo in the analysis by drug class?
    
    -   Oral dopamine antagonists and tachykinin-1 antagonists were found to be superior to placebo in the analysis by drug class.
5.  Which drugs were found to be the most effective for individual symptoms of gastroparesis?
    
    -   Oral metoclopramide was found to be the most effective for nausea, fullness, and bloating, based on only one small trial. Tradipitant and TZP-102 were more effective than placebo for nausea and TZP-102 was superior to placebo for fullness. None of the drugs studied were more effective than placebo for vomiting or abdominal pain.

1.  What was the primary endpoint of interest in the analysis?
    
    -   The primary endpoint of interest was global gastroparesis symptoms.
2.  How was heterogeneity between studies evaluated in the analysis?
    
    -   Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated by examining the level of confidence in most comparisons across the network.
3.  Were any drugs found to be more effective than placebo in patients with diabetic gastroparesis?
    
    -   No drugs were found to be more effective than placebo in patients with diabetic gastroparesis.
4.  Which drug was found to be the least likely to be associated with adverse events or withdrawals?
    
    -   Camicinal was the drug found to be the least likely to be associated with adverse events or withdrawals.
5.  Which drug was found to be significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events than placebo?
    
    -   Prucalopride was found to be significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events than placebo.


6.  Was there evidence of publication bias or other small study effects in the primary analysis?
    
    -   There was no evidence of publication bias or other small study effects in the primary analysis.
7.  How was the assumption of transitivity addressed in the analysis?
    
    -   The assumption of transitivity, which refers to the idea that indirect comparisons between drugs assume that any patient included in the network could have been recruited to any of the trials and assigned to any of the drugs, was addressed by considering factors such as differences in patient population, criteria for response, and method of diagnosis of gastroparesis that could affect transitivity.
8.  How was the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the study?
    
    -   The intention-to-treat analysis in the study assumed that all dropouts were treatment failures.
9.  What statistical model was used in the analysis?
    
    -   A random effects model was used in the analysis in order to avoid overestimating the efficacy of therapies.
10.  How was the literature search conducted for the systematic review?
    

-   The literature search for the systematic review was conducted rigorously and reproducibly, with the eligibility judging and data extraction performed independently by two investigators. The search also included clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished RCTs and contact with trial authors to obtain supplementary data, and imputed dichotomous responder data to maximize the number of eligible studies.
